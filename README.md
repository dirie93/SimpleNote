# SimpleNote

In this project, I created a note-taking app, which allows users to keep track of their thoughts. Users have the ability to not only save their notes but also delete them upon their discretion.

## User-Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

```
